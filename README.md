This repository showcases a comprehensive project involving Power Query for data cleaning and modelling. The project highlights the use of advanced features such as web scraping and local data storage to dynamically create and update live datasets. The integration of these functions ensures that the data remains up-to-date and accurate, automating the process of data retrieval and transformation.

**Key features include:**

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Leveraged Power Query's robust tools to clean and model complex datasets.
**Web Scraping**: Implemented web scraping techniques to extract data from online sources, enabling real-time updates.
**Local Data Storage**: Utilized local storage features to maintain and modify datasets, ensuring seamless integration and continuous data updates.
**Live Dataset Updates**: Created a system that automatically reflects changes in data, providing an always-current dataset for analysis.
